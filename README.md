# CORORNA_VIRUS_PREDICTION-USING MACHINE LEARNING

Coronavirus 2019(COVID19) project is focussed on forecasting the spread of the virus in the coming days. In this project, both linear regression model and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used which further compares the efficiency of both models.It also predicts the number of persons in different regions that can be affected by the spread of this virus in next week. The implementation of this project gives analytical and visual understanding of the coronavirus prediction model as well as tells the number of confirmed cases in various nations.

# Overall process in four subtasks

1. Pulling the GitHub raw formatted data into .csv file.
2. Extracting the data using pandas.
3. Cleaning the data like removal of outliers.
4. Visualizing the data using different ways such as bar graph, pie chart etcetera.

# FUTURE SCOPE

The future project will be target on the areas within the provinces or cities where it is surging up and help the government to deploy or allocate the resources to that particular city.
